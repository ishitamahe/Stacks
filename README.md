# Stacks
## Aim
To execute push, pop and display functions in a Stack.
## Theory
A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT). Stacks use the princliple of LIFO, i.e, Last in, First out. There are 2 main functions of stacks, that are- PUSH and POP. Push is a function that is used to insert or input an element in the stack. Pop is a function that is used to delete or remove an element from the top of the stack. Whenever the stack is empty, the value of top is -1. When the stack is full, the value of top is max-1. If the stack is empty, no element can be poped or removed and the stack represents "Stack Underflow". If the stack is full, no element can be pushed or inserted into the stack and the stack represents "Stack Overfull". The display function displays all the elements present in the stack at that given time. Stacks find applications in the following: Reversing a string, Checking the proper opening and closing of paranthesis etc.
